# ClubConnect
ClubConnect is a web application designed to help community college students easily discover and engage with campus clubs. The platform offers an interactive and engaging way to explore clubs through an interactive campus map, giving students instant access to information about where club meetings are held.
For many students, finding opportunities to connect with others in their major or interests can be challenging, especially when club information is scattered or outdated.
Our platform solves this problem by providing a centralized, efficient website where students can browse and join clubs offered at their college. ClubConnect showcases key details such as meeting times, upcoming events, contact information, and club descriptions. 
Additionally, the app includes a convenient check-in and check-out feature that allows students to mark their attendance, making it easier for club organizers to track participation and engagement.
